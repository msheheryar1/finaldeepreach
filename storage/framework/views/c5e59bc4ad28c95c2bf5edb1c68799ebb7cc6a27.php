				<div class=""><p>Deepreach.com<span style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-family: &quot;open sans&quot;, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span>provides this
            Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure
            of
            personally identifiable information received from users of this website, located
            at&nbsp;<u>https://deepreach.com</u>&nbsp;</p> <p>By using our Site you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy
            Policy
            now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using or touching information in
            any
            way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing
            information,
            all of which activities will take place in the United Kingdom and may also take place outside of the United
            Kingdom at the discretion of DeepReach. If you reside outside the United Kingdom your
            personally identifiable information will be transferred to the United Kingdom, and may also be transferred
            outside of the United Kingdom, and processed and stored there under British privacy standards.</p> <p>By visiting our Site and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in the
            United Kingdom and outside of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Information Collection and Use</h3> <p>Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and
            services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with
            you,
            and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Information Collected Upon Registration</h3> <p>If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a
            registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to DeepReach. This happens in a
            number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing
            materials
            and information. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your
            IP
            address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and other information
            that
            you decide to provide us with.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Use of Contact Information</h3> <p>In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about,
            our
            products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no
            longer
            wish to receive such information or communications from us, please un-follow us, or follow the unsubscribe
            instructions provided in any of the communications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Log Data</h3> <p>
            When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you
            visit
            a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the
            domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any
            advertisements on
            which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will
            be
            different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for
            the
            Site's technical administration.
        </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Cookies</h3> <p>Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve
            the
            Site and our service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. We do not
            use
            cookies to collect personally identifiable information. DeepReach may use both session cookies and persistent
            cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by
            our
            users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our services. A session cookie
            enables
            certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or
            leave
            the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on
            subsequent
            visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions.
            Most
            Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to
            stop
            accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without
            limitation, hosting and maintenance, billing, customer relationship, database storage and management, and
            direct
            marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but
            only
            to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding
            contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.</p> <p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</strong></p> <p>DeepReach cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply
            with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or
            private
            parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process
            (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of DeepReach or a third party, the safety of the
            public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to
            comply
            with the law.</p> <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p> <p>DeepReach may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally
            identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in
            the
            event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's
            planned
            processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Changing or Deleting Information</h3> <p>If you are a registered user of the Site, you may access and update or correct the information you provided
            to us

            information.
            We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from
            unauthorized access. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security,
            confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or
            conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay,
            consistent
            with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of
            the
            breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Links to Other Websites</h3> <p>Our Site contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement,
            authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over
            third
            party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect
            data
            or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the
            use or
            disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the
            privacy
            policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Our Policy Towards Children</h3> <p>The Site is not directed to persons under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has

            that
            a child under 13 has provided us with personal identifiable Information, we will delete such information
            from
            our files.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Changes to This Policy</h3> <p>
            This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply to information
