            (including non-contractual disputes or claims).</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">&nbsp;</h3> <h3 class="text-2xl">Entire Agreement and Severability.</h3> <p>These Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and DeepReach with respect to the Services and
            supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic)
            between you and DeepReach with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found
            to
            be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so
            that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3 class="text-2xl">Miscellaneous</h3> <p><strong>Force Majeure.</strong>&nbsp;DeepReach shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations
            hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond DeepReach’s reasonable control, including, without
            limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.</p> <p><strong>Assignment.</strong>&nbsp;These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable,
            transferable or sublicensable by you except with DeepReachs’s prior written consent. DeepReach may assign,
            transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent.</p> <p><strong>Agency.</strong>&nbsp;No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as

            result of these Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any
            respect.</p> <p><strong>Notices.</strong>&nbsp;Unless otherwise specified in these Terms of Service, all notices under these
            Terms
            of Service will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally

            or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed,
            if
            transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized
            overnight delivery service.</p> <p><strong>No Waiver.</strong>&nbsp;The failure of DeepReach to enforce any part of these Terms of Service shall

            Waiver
            of compliance in any particular instance, does not mean that we will do so in the future. In order for any
            waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, DeepReach must provide you with written
            notice
            of such waiver, provided by one of its authorized representatives.</p> <p><strong>Headings.</strong>&nbsp;The section and paragraph headings in these Terms of Service are for
